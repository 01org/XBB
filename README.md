XForm Building Blocks (XBB)
------------------------------------------------
C++11 library to enable composition of 3d transforms

* Use minimum number of trigonometric operations, multiplications, divisions, and additions
* Take full advantage of known constant's through multiple transform concatenations (multiplications), 
* Reverse order of concatenations vs. performing an expensive "inverse".

For motivation, an introduction, and practical results see [Slashing the Cost of 3d Matrix Math using X-Form (Transform) Building Blocks]
